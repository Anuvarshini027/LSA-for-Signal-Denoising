# LSA-for-Signal-Denoising

The objective of this project is to perform ECG SIGNAL DENOISING BASED ON WEIGHT REGULARIZED LEAST SQUARE METHOD 

->An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check a heart's rhythm and electrical activity.

->It can be used to investigate symptoms of a possible heart problem, such as chest pain, palpitations, dizziness and shortness of breath.

->A typical ECG tracing of a normal heartbeat (or cardiac cycle) consists of a P wave, a QRS complex and a T wave.
